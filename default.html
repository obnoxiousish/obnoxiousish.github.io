This is my 'blog'-esque website I would hope I maintain everytime I do something I think is relatively note worthy.
Considering I tweet a thousand times a day that could be many things!<br/>
<br/>

I'm a 18 year old system administrator and pythonista.<br/>
If you wish to contact me, look at my twitter or <a href="mailto:obnoxious@dongcorp.org">email</a> me.
